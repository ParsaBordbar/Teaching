# Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to our learning hub! Here, we dive into the world of programming, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced concepts. Our journey begins with a simple:

```c
printf("HELLO WORLD! ðŸ˜Ž");
```

This repository is a comprehensive guide for university-level topics, primarily focusing on the C and Python programming languages.

## **C Programming**

We cover a wide range of topics in C, providing a solid foundation for anyone looking to learn or brush up their skills. The topics include:

- Getting Started with C
- Understanding Variables
- Input & Output Operations

- Structures

Each topic is accompanied by practical exercises to reinforce learning.

## **Python Programming**

We also explore Python, a versatile language known for its simplicity and robustness. While this section is continually updated with new topics, it currently includes:

- Data Structures
- Recursive Functions 
- Search Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy Library
- Assignments from "Python for Everybody" Data Structures
- Regular Expressions (regex)
