#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
#and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages.
#The program looks for 'From ' lines
#and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
#The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the
#sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
#After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary
#using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
